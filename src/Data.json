Women and families often grieve these losses deeply. Women may also worry that they are sick or did something to cause the losses. Pregnancy loss is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation. The loss of a pregnancy after 24 weeks gestation is called a stillbirth. A diagnosis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss or RPL could be considered after the loss of two or more pregnancies. This includes pregnancies after spontaneous conception and after assisted reproduction (e.g. IUI and IVF/ICSI). Ectopic pregnancies and molar pregnancies are not included. There are various causes for recurrent miscarriage, and some can be treated. Most couples with RPL have a higher chance of a live birth in their next pregnancy than of having another pregnancy loss, but that does vary depending on maternal age and the number of pregnancy losses and on whether a likely cause has been found."

                        "Fertility is the ability to conceive and bear children. Many factors can affect a person's fertility, including lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, stress levels, alcohol and tobacco use, and exposure to toxins. Understanding how these lifestyle factors can impact fertility can help individuals make informed decisions about their health and improve their chances of having a family.",
                        "Diet: A healthy diet that is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals can positively impact fertility. For example, consuming foods high in folic acid, iron, and zinc, such as leafy greens, legumes, and lean meats, can improve sperm and egg quality. On the other hand, a diet that is high in trans fats, processed foods, and sugar can reduce fertility and increase the risk of hormonal imbalances.",
                        "Exercise: Regular exercise is essential for maintaining good health and can also improve fertility. However, excessive exercise can have a negative impact on fertility, particularly for women. Over-exercising can cause hormonal imbalances and disrupt the menstrual cycle, making it difficult to conceive. It is important to find a balance between regular exercise and adequate rest",
                        "Stress: Chronic stress can have a negative impact on fertility by interfering with the hormonal balance necessary for ovulation and sperm production. In addition, stress can also affect the immune system, making it more difficult to conceive. Relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing, can help reduce stress levels and improve fertility.",
                        "Alcohol and tobacco use: Alcohol consumption can have a negative impact on both male and female fertility. Excessive alcohol consumption can reduce sperm quality and count, and can also disrupt the menstrual cycle, making it more difficult to conceive. Tobacco use can also reduce fertility by damaging sperm and eggs, and decreasing the chances of conception.",
                        "can negatively impact fertility by altering hormonal balance and damaging sperm and eggs. Limiting exposure to these toxins and maintaining a healthy environment can help protect fertility.",

Adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes a nutritious diet, regular exercise, stress management, limited alcohol and tobacco use, and reduced exposure to toxins can help improve fertility and increase the chances of conception. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations and to address any concerns about fertility."

                        "Fertility treatments have come a long way in recent years, with new technologies and techniques being developed to help couples who struggle with infertility. Here are some of the latest advances in this field",
                        "In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): IVF is a common method for fertility treatment and has seen significant improvements in recent years. One of the latest advances is the use of time-lapse imaging technology, which allows embryologists to monitor the development of embryos in real-time, selecting the best ones for transfer with improved accuracy.",
                        "Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI): ICSI is a procedure where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg, improving the chances of fertilization. The latest advancements include the use of a more advanced sperm selection technique known as \"micro-TESE\" that can identify the most viable sperm for use in ICSI, leading to higher success rates.",
                        "Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT): PGT is a test performed on embryos before they are implanted in the uterus to check for any genetic abnormalities. The latest advancements in PGT include \"PGT-A,\" which screens embryos for aneuploidy, or an abnormal number of chromosomes, and \"PGT-M,\" which screens for specific genetic disorders.",
                        "Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET): FET involves transferring previously frozen embryos to the uterus, rather than fresh ones. The latest advancements in FET include the use of improved freezing techniques, such as vitrification, which reduces the risk of damage to the embryos and increases success rates.",
                        "Ovarian Stimulation: Ovarian stimulation is a crucial part of many fertility treatments, as it increases the number of eggs produced by the ovaries. The latest advancements include the use of gentler stimulation protocols that minimize the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious condition.",
                        "In conclusion, fertility treatments have seen significant advancements in recent years, offering couples new and improved methods to help them achieve their dream of starting a family. While success rates are not 100% and individual results may vary, these advances have brought hope and happiness to many families who otherwise may not have been able to have children."

The menstrual cycle of the egg donor and the recipient's use of birth control tablets are often coordinated. On the second day of menstruation, the receiver starts taking estradiol tablets to prepare her uterus, while the donor starts receiving injections to stimulate her ovaries. Once the donor's follicles are prepared, which typically takes 11–12 days, the egg retrieval operation is carried out under anaesthetic and ultrasound monitoring. The recipient's partner gives a sample of his semen on the day of egg retrieval. The gametes are then fertilised in a laboratory setting. The recipient is given luteal support medicines. Three to five days later, a USG directs the transfer of one to two embryos into the recipient's uterus. If there are extra embryos, they can be stored in the freezer for later use."

Having a miscarriage doesn’t mean a woman will have another miscarriage if she tries again. But some women suffer more than one miscarriage. This is called recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Women and families often grieve these losses deeply. Women may also worry that they are sick or did something to cause the losses. RPL, however, is often a natural process. Less than half of recurrent miscarriages have an obvious or treatable cause. Almost two-thirds of women with RPL will eventually have a healthy pregnancy — often without any extra treatment. If you have suffered two or more miscarriages, you should talk with your health-care provider. Often, women decide to continue trying to get pregnant naturally.

                "The majority of embryo transfers in the past took place on days two or three. In any event, the majority of excellent clinics have moved on to routinely performing day five (blastocyst) transfers. Tragically, many IVF clinics in India still transfer embryos on the second or third day because this is not yet the common option. This is primarily due to their lack of tremendous confidence in the capabilities of their research facility and their embryologist's ability to culture eggs up to day five. They justify this by telling the patient that it's preferable for the embryo to hatch inside the uterus earlier, which is why they lean toward transferring the embryo into the uterus. However, there are a lot of disadvantages to this, therefore you should request that your doctor perform a blastocyst transfer on your behalf.",
                "When compared to Day 2 or Day 3 transfer, blastocysts have a higher possibility of implanting, hence the success percentage is higher with blastocyst transfer. They are more  likely since they are more developed and have more cells. When compared to transferring three or four Day 3 embryos, the specialist can reduce the number of embryos to be transferred and exchange only a few blastocysts while still having a high pregnancy rate.",
                "Additionally, since the expert is only exchanging 1–2 blastocysts, you can freeze the extra blastocysts, giving you the chance to complete multiple cycles in the future. In light of the fact that the overall pregnancy rate is increasing, this makes it more useful. ",
                "The final and most important reason to request a blastocyst transfer is that you won't have to endure the scary 2-week wait during which you won't know whether you will become pregnant or not if you have poor quality embryos. Therefore, if the IVF cycle fails after exchanging Day 3 embryos, it is impossible to determine if the problem was that the foetus did not develop further or whether there was some other reason why the implantation failed. Even more so, you're uncertain as to whether your embryo will live for five days or not.",
                "This is especially true for older women with fewer eggs. Such women are more likely to experience a failed IVF because their embryos are more likely to halt and not develop into blastocysts. Many of the embryos can be genetically abnormal.",
                "These are the patients who might benefit most greatly from a blastocyst transfer. However, because they typically have poor ovarian response, the doctor is reluctant to develop the embryos all the way to the blastocyst stage when just 3–4 eggs are collected. The patient will blame them if it doesn't work out. For this reason, they would much rather transfer the embryos back into the uterus, where they could claim \"implantation failure\" if the cycle did not succeed.",
                "However, following the embryo swap, the patient is duped into believing that \"Amazingly, possibly this embryo may implant and grow into a baby,\" which is why they are so optimistic during the waiting period.",
                "This false expectation is hurting. They believe that their uterus rejected the embryo at the time when the cycle ends prematurely, which is when they are persuaded to pursue surrogacy. This is dreadful advise which is absolutely imperfect on the grounds that the issue is with the egg and not with the uterus.",

Once the donor's follicles are prepared, which typically takes 11–12 days, the egg retrieval operation is carried out under anaesthetic and ultrasound monitoring. The recipient's partner gives a sample of his semen on the day of egg retrieval. The gametes are then fertilised in a laboratory setting. The recipient is given luteal support medicines. Three to five days later, a USG directs the transfer of one to two embryos into the recipient's uterus. If there are extra embryos, they can be stored in the freezer for later use."
