In vitro is Latin for “in glass” and refers to the laboratory Petri dish in which the egg and sperm are combined. When the eggs are fertilised and become embryos, the physician determines which embryos to transfer to the woman.",

Any remaining embryos can be frozen and stored for future use or donated to other couples. In vitro fertilization can overcome most causes of male and female infertility.",

Tragically, many IVF clinics in India still transfer embryos on the second or third day because this is not yet the common option. This is primarily due to their lack of tremendous confidence in the capabilities of their research facility and their embryologist's ability to culture eggs up to day five. They justify this by telling the patient that it's preferable for the embryo to hatch inside the uterus earlier, which is why they lean toward transferring the embryo into the uterus.

Therefore, if the IVF cycle fails after exchanging Day 3 embryos, it is impossible to determine if the problem was that the foetus did not develop further or whether there was some other reason why the implantation failed.

Once the donor's follicles are prepared, which typically takes 11–12 days, the egg retrieval operation is carried out under anaesthetic and ultrasound monitoring. The recipient's partner gives a sample of his semen on the day of egg retrieval. The gametes are then fertilised in a laboratory setting. The recipient is given luteal support medicines. Three to five days later, a USG directs the transfer of one to two embryos into the recipient's uterus. If there are extra embryos, they can be stored in the freezer for later use."
