Tragically, many IVF clinics in India still transfer embryos on the second or third day because this is not yet the common option. This is primarily due to their lack of tremendous confidence in the capabilities of their research facility and their embryologist's ability to culture eggs up to day five. They justify this by telling the patient that it's preferable for the embryo to hatch inside the uterus earlier, which is why they lean toward transferring the embryo into the uterus.

Therefore, if the IVF cycle fails after exchanging Day 3 embryos, it is impossible to determine if the problem was that the foetus did not develop further or whether there was some other reason why the implantation failed.

With the help of vitrification, extra blastocysts can also be successfully cryopreserved so that pregnancies can be carried out in the future."

                "The majority of embryo transfers in the past took place on days two or three. In any event, the majority of excellent clinics have moved on to routinely performing day five (blastocyst) transfers. Tragically, many IVF clinics in India still transfer embryos on the second or third day because this is not yet the common option. This is primarily due to their lack of tremendous confidence in the capabilities of their research facility and their embryologist's ability to culture eggs up to day five. They justify this by telling the patient that it's preferable for the embryo to hatch inside the uterus earlier, which is why they lean toward transferring the embryo into the uterus. However, there are a lot of disadvantages to this, therefore you should request that your doctor perform a blastocyst transfer on your behalf.",
                "When compared to Day 2 or Day 3 transfer, blastocysts have a higher possibility of implanting, hence the success percentage is higher with blastocyst transfer. They are more  likely since they are more developed and have more cells. When compared to transferring three or four Day 3 embryos, the specialist can reduce the number of embryos to be transferred and exchange only a few blastocysts while still having a high pregnancy rate.",
                "Additionally, since the expert is only exchanging 1–2 blastocysts, you can freeze the extra blastocysts, giving you the chance to complete multiple cycles in the future. In light of the fact that the overall pregnancy rate is increasing, this makes it more useful. ",
                "The final and most important reason to request a blastocyst transfer is that you won't have to endure the scary 2-week wait during which you won't know whether you will become pregnant or not if you have poor quality embryos. Therefore, if the IVF cycle fails after exchanging Day 3 embryos, it is impossible to determine if the problem was that the foetus did not develop further or whether there was some other reason why the implantation failed. Even more so, you're uncertain as to whether your embryo will live for five days or not.",
                "This is especially true for older women with fewer eggs. Such women are more likely to experience a failed IVF because their embryos are more likely to halt and not develop into blastocysts. Many of the embryos can be genetically abnormal.",
                "These are the patients who might benefit most greatly from a blastocyst transfer. However, because they typically have poor ovarian response, the doctor is reluctant to develop the embryos all the way to the blastocyst stage when just 3–4 eggs are collected. The patient will blame them if it doesn't work out. For this reason, they would much rather transfer the embryos back into the uterus, where they could claim \"implantation failure\" if the cycle did not succeed.",
                "However, following the embryo swap, the patient is duped into believing that \"Amazingly, possibly this embryo may implant and grow into a baby,\" which is why they are so optimistic during the waiting period.",
                "This false expectation is hurting. They believe that their uterus rejected the embryo at the time when the cycle ends prematurely, which is when they are persuaded to pursue surrogacy. This is dreadful advise which is absolutely imperfect on the grounds that the issue is with the egg and not with the uterus.",

Once the donor's follicles are prepared, which typically takes 11–12 days, the egg retrieval operation is carried out under anaesthetic and ultrasound monitoring. The recipient's partner gives a sample of his semen on the day of egg retrieval. The gametes are then fertilised in a laboratory setting. The recipient is given luteal support medicines. Three to five days later, a USG directs the transfer of one to two embryos into the recipient's uterus. If there are extra embryos, they can be stored in the freezer for later use."
